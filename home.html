  <h3>Consent Form</h2>
  <p><strong>Researcher:</strong>  Jarryullah Ahmad</p>

  <p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto</p>

<p><strong>Background and Purpose</strong></p>

<p>You are invited to participate in a research study investigating color usage in creating data visualizations. 
  This research involves a questionnaire that will evaluate your education level, level of familiarity with charts, 
  and your ability to answer questions from data visualizations and an experiment involving selection of appropriate color 
  palettes for certain visualizations.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p>
<p>To participate you must be in 18 years of age or older and be comfortable with communicating in English.</p>

<p><strong>Voluntary Participation & Early Withdrawal</strong></p>
<p>Your decision to participate is voluntary and you are free to withdraw at any time without any consequences. 
  You are not required to answer any questions you do not feel comfortable answering.</p>

<p>Upon completion of the experiment, you will be given a participant ID to submit on the Amazon Mechanical Turk website. 
  You can withdraw from the study either by not submitting your participant ID, or by emailing the researchers with your 
  participant ID and requesting to withdraw. In both cases your data will be destroyed and not included in the published 
  results of the research study. After results are made public, anonymized data may be shared publicly and you will no longer 
  be able to withdraw from the study.</p>

<p><strong>Confidentiality and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>You will not be asked to share your name and participants will be referred to as a participant ID number only. 
  During data collection, data will be stored on a secure, encrypted server. After completion of the experiment, data
   will be stored on an encrypted hard drive of a password-protected lab computer that is only accessible by the researcher.</p>

<p>-	The purpose of the study is to understand color usage in creating data visualizations;</p>
<p>-	I agree to have my responses recorded, as well as the amount of time spent using any interactive elements in the
   questionnaire; </p>
<p>-	The researchers do not foresee any risks or stresses beyond what one might experience in a typical day of work;</p>

<p>-	I am free to withdraw from the study at any time before the results of the study are made public 
  (even after the completion of the study) and if I do wish so, the researcher will also destroy all respective 
  data collected insofar;</p>
<p>-	All data collected in this study will be kept secure. Responses will be stored in a secure device. 
  Only the researchers involved in this study will have access. In all data files, my responses will be identified 
  with a code in order to preserve confidentiality. All data containing potentially identifying information will 
  be destroyed 3 years after publication of results;</p>
<p>-	Data collected may be used in research journals, conferences, or other scholarly activities, or it may 
  be shared publicly with other researchers. In these cases, no identifying information will be provided to the audience;</p>
<p>-	I am at least 18 years of age;</p>
<p>-	I am free to ask questions about the process at any time. I can ask by contacting:<br>
